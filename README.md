# BMS-Molecular-Translation
Kaggle competition of chemical image-to-text translation: A build-from-scratch cnn-transformer model for translating 2d chemical structures to InChI notations
## Project Description
The 2D skeletal formula is a structural notation of organic molecules used by organic chemists for centuries. International Chemical Identifier, InChI, is the machine-readable chemical descriptions. There exist decades of scanned image documents that can not be searched for InChI directly. The goal of this project is to build up a deep learning model that could link the molecular structure images
